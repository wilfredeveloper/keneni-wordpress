# News & Events Page - Automatic Setup

## What I've Done

I've integrated the News & Events page directly into your theme code so it works automatically without needing to create pages in WordPress admin.

### Files Modified:

1. **functions.php** - Added URL rewriting functionality
2. **page-news-events.php** - Updated to work as a standalone template
3. **style.css** - Already contains all the styling

### How It Works:

The theme now automatically handles the `/news-events/` URL by:
- Adding a custom rewrite rule that captures `/news-events/` requests
- Redirecting those requests to load the `page-news-events.php` template
- Setting proper SEO meta tags for the page

## Activation Steps

### Step 1: Refresh Permalinks
After uploading the updated files, you need to refresh the WordPress permalink structure:

**Option A: Through WordPress Admin (Recommended)**
1. Go to WordPress Admin → Settings → Permalinks
2. Click "Save Changes" (you don't need to change anything, just save)
3. This flushes the rewrite rules and activates the new URL

**Option B: Through Code (if you have access)**
Add this to your functions.php temporarily and visit any page on your site:
```php
flush_rewrite_rules();
```
Then remove the line.

### Step 2: Test the Page
1. Visit your website
2. Click on "News & Events" in the navigation menu
3. The page should now load with the custom design

## What You Get

✅ **Automatic URL Handling**: `/news-events/` now works automatically
✅ **No WordPress Admin Required**: Everything is handled in theme code
✅ **SEO Optimized**: Proper page titles and meta descriptions
✅ **Fully Integrated**: Uses your existing header and footer
✅ **Mobile Responsive**: Works perfectly on all devices

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get a 404:
1. **Check file upload**: Make sure `page-news-events.php` and the updated `functions.php` are uploaded
2. **Flush permalinks**: Go to Settings → Permalinks and click Save Changes
3. **Check URL**: Make sure you're visiting `/news-events/` (with or without trailing slash)

### If the page loads but looks wrong:
1. **Clear cache**: Clear any caching plugins or browser cache
2. **Check CSS**: Make sure the updated `style.css` file was uploaded

## Customization

The page content is now hardcoded in `page-news-events.php`. To modify:
- **Change content**: Edit the HTML in `page-news-events.php`
- **Update images**: Replace the Unsplash URLs with your own images
- **Modify styling**: Edit the CSS in `style.css`

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No Database Dependencies**: Works without creating WordPress pages
2. **Version Control Friendly**: Everything is in theme files
3. **Easy Deployment**: Just upload files and flush permalinks
4. **Maintainable**: All code is in your theme directory

The News & Events page is now fully integrated into your theme and will work automatically!
